# Population Simulation

The aims of this project are as such:
1. Basic:
   - Square grid, with 3 categories of animals/entities:
     - Plant, can't move, has nutritious value, randomly spawns
     - Plant eater, can move slower, can reproduce with same species, eats plant
     - Meat eater, can move, fastest on the grid, can reproduce with same species, eats plant eater
2. Intermediate:
    - Add vision and hearing to the animals
    - Add evolution via genetic algorithms to animals
    - Add boundaries to the grip

Ideas:
- Boundaries:
  - Water
